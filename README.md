# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description

- Why did you build this project?  
We all have maybe 4 or 5 passwords that we use for literally all of our accounts, right?  
If you struggle to think of a new password once you've run out of options, (like I do...)  
why not let an app pick one for you? This makes choosing a new password as easy as clicking a button!
Just... don't forget to write it down and keep it somewhere safe. ðŸ˜…

- (What did you learn?)  
This project required pretty much my entire repertoire of coding syntax and logic knowledge thus far.  
And a ton of stuff I didn't really know how to do, also!  
I've learned how to create arrays using a function based on user input, add those arrays to an even  
bigger agragate array, and convert said array into a string of random choices from within the array!

- I've also strengthened my knowledge of JavaScript syntax and logic, learned a ton of new functions,  
operators, using results of functions as variable inside of other functions, applications of those  
different combinations of functions and just... a lot!


## Usage
Just click on the "Generate Password" button and answer the following prompts to create your password!
Make sure to input a value within the range.

Once you've answered all the prompts accordingly, you should see your shiny new password pop right up!
